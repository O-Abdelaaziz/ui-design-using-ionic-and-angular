 * App Global CSS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Put style rules here that you want to apply globally. These styles are for
 * the entire app and not just one component. Additionally, this file can be
 * used as an entry point to import other CSS/Sass files to be included in the
 * output CSS.
 * For more information on global stylesheets, visit the documentation:

///* 1. UTILITIES AND SETTINGS (SASS Modules) */
//// This section should only contain @use for SASS-level assets (mixins, functions, variables)
//@use "./theme/partials/mixins" as mixin;
//
///* 2. EXTERNAL CSS IMPORTS */
//// This must remain an @import because the Ionic files are pure CSS.
////@use "./theme/partials/ionic-framework";
//
///* 3. CUSTOM STYLES (SASS Partials) */
//// These are Sass partials, so we use @use for namespace support.
//// Note: When you @use a file, you don't typically need a namespace if the file doesn't expose
//// mixins, functions, or variables you need to call/reference.
//// However, using the full path is fine.

//@use "./theme/partials/_typography.scss";
//@use "./theme/partials/_general.scss";

//// If you have any final custom CSS that MUST live outside a partial, put it here:
//// ion-title { font-weight: bold; }

// 1. Sass Modules/Base - Must come first
@use "./theme/partials/mixins" as mixin;
// 2. Framework Base - Foundation styles
@use "./theme/partials/ionic-framework";
// 3. Custom Overrides - Loaded last to win CSS cascade
@use "./theme/partials/typography";
@use "./theme/partials/general";
